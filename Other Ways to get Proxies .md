# ByePassHub > Other ways to get Proxies | updated Sep 12
On this page, I'm going to give you **THE BEST** resources to find proxies, exploits, bypasses, etc. that are *hidden* to the public eye, so <br>
1. You can get the freshest links and exploits ðŸ˜Ž
2. Those links and bypasses are more likely to **stay** being unblocked
3. You can get **more**, ðŸ“ˆ
4. and I can do less (i won't be updating that often) ðŸ“‰

## Resource #1: Proxy and Exploit Discord Servers
After joining these servers (make sure you have a discord account first), you can verify and access plenty of links. <br>
**Usually, these servers have a channel called `community links` where people would post fresh links that they made.**  <br>
They also have things called **link dispensers**, these links are PRIVATE, 100% working, and probably the most secure links. <br>

They also have instructions for BYOD, meaning creating your own proxy site, and you could follow their instructions too (or follow mine [here](https://github.com/wea-f/ByePassHub/blob/main/MakeYourOwnLink.md)). <br>

## Resource #4: BYOD
You can even make your own links with a specific domain. <br>
This means if a specific domain is unblocked for you, you could try making more proxies with the same domain, which will all be unblocked. <br>
You could see the instructions [here](https://github.com/wea-f/ByePassHub/blob/main/MakeYourOwnLink.md), or join some of the above discord servers with more specific instructions (and if you need help) <br>



<br>
Anyways, thats it, hope you explored all of these proxy hubs and got some links. Also make sure to not publicly share the link dispenser links, there are rules against that, and they will ban you if you do so. <br>
<br>
This collection is getting quite popular, this means links/bypasses are getting blocked faster and faster. Having an archive of links and bypasses is dangerous and admins can easily copy and paste this list and block them (or just block this site). <br>
  > Basically, this collection is public to everyone, and it is very easy to access, especially to admins. <br>
